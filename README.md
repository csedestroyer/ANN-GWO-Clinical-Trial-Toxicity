Drugs, composed of chemical and biological substances, aim to improve health but often pose toxic risks, including carcinogenic and mutagenic effects. With only 10% of Phase 1 drug candidates gaining FDA approval—mostly due to efficacy and safety issues—traditional drug discovery remains slow, risky, and inefficient, with a 96% failure rate. In silico methods, leveraging machine learning, offer a more efficient approach to predicting toxicity by automating analysis and reducing reliance on experimental trials. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often hindered by the labor-intensive nature of manual parameter tuning, which requires significant expertise and computational resources. To address this limitation, this research employs the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) method, a highly efficient strategy for solving optimization problems, to enhance chemical toxicity predictions using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The best-performing ANN configuration, featuring five hidden layers, a tanh activation function, and Adam optimizer, attained the accuracy of 0.966 and F1-Score of 0.708.

In this study, ANN designs for medicine toxicity prediction were optimized using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Among the evaluated schemes, Scheme 4 fared better than the baseline and other optimized models, within the test set, the models achieve the accuracy of 0.966 and the F1-Score value of 0.708. Its balanced five-layer architecture and the tanh activation function, which improved generalization and successfully captured nonlinear relationships, are the main reasons for its success. Because Scheme 4 balanced recall (0.823) and precision (0.622), it is particularly effective at predicting dangerous samples. These results highlight the importance of activation function selection and building design. Future studies could improve ANN structures even more by investigating sophisticated metaheuristic approaches and dynamic parameter searches, opening the door to even more reliable toxicity prediction models.
